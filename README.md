File `RPS.py` contains a function called `player`. 
The function takes an argument that is a string and will receive an empty string as an argument for the first game in a match.

All code is written in `RPS.py`, tests relate to `main.py` as `main.py` imports from `RPS_game.py`.

Click the "run" button and `main.py` will run.
